# OpenVMP

## It's free

All materials in all OpenVMP repositories are published using the Apache 2.0 open-source license. Unleash your creativity without anything holding you back!

## It's aimed to help inventors, not patent trolls

To prevent patent trolls from making claims for minor improvements on top of the information published by OpenVMP, the following claims are made about the features and inventions that have already been considered and planned by OpenVMP contributors.

**`ATTENTION!!! Do not hesitate to make a pull request with nothing else but just more claims (or corrections to the existing ones) to protect the project from patent trolls.`**

- OpenVMP units will communicate with each other, other devices (either human operated or not, either mobile or static infrastructure), networking backends, cloud services, API endpoints. The peers and corresponding communication protocols can be standardized for all OpenVMP units, for specific types of OpenVMP units, or customized for individual robots, fleets, tasks or locations.
- OpenVMP units will use various communication protocols (datagram, stream or mixed), wired or wireless (to ground base stations or satellites), with or without security (confidentiality, integrity and/or privacy), tunneling and obfuscation techniques, WAN or LAN optimization techniques.
- OpenVMP units will have secure key materials (using one or more algorithms) that will be ephemeral (stored in various kinds of volatile memory), persistent (stored in various kinds of non-volatile memory) and stored in hardware (such as TMP and various kinds of secure elements). These key materials will be used for identity and data protection purposes either at the communication transport level or for individual payloads (entire payloads or a subset of fields).
- OpenVMP units will optionally use more computing units to offload continuous or ad hoc data processing using CPU, GPU, FPGA and other technologies.
- OpenVMP units will charge themselves and each other using energy received from stationary charging points, regular power outlets, external batteries (e.g. in cars or found elsewhere), low or high voltage power lines (with or without contact), natural environment (solar, wind etc)
- OpenVMP units will carry standardized and custom payload modules that will be autonomous or powered and/or controlled by OpenVMP.
- OpenVMP units will attach to other units (of the same or different kind) using one or more methods (including mechanical, magnetic, electromagnetic forces), using attachment mechanisms that are bound to its own frame or payload modules.
- OpenVMP units will attach themselves to stationary (e.g. floor, wall or ceiling mounted) or mobile (car or truck bed, side or bottom) docking ports using the same attachment mechanisms as the ones units use to attach to each other, or using other mechanisms attached to the robot frames or to payload modules.
- OpenVMP units may reuse the attachment mechanisms for power and/or signal transmission (potentially using solutions like CY8CPL10). Alternatively, complete or partial contact surfaces can be used for transmission. The power transmission can be used for powering up the peer units and/or for charging them. The signal transmission may include 1) a security authentication and authorization exchange, 2) data loss compensation etc.
- Specific OpenVMP unit types will be designed to work in space (by using better fit electric, electronic and mechanical components and other means) and may use magnets on the wheels, limbs and other parts of the robot.
- Specific OpenVMP unit types will be designed to work under water or other liquids (e.g. to work in pipes) by using better fit electric, electronic and mechanical components and other means.
- OpenVMP units will feature all publicly available algorithms for odometry, perception, navigation, motion planning and motion control.
- OpenVMP units will use a custom motion control algorithm that takes the specific robot configuration into account to optimize movements and prevent collisions. The acceptable joint position range will depend on the current position and velocity of all other joints at the time.
- OpenvMP units will use distributed computing algorithms that would allow them to combine or share computational resources, storage (including memory) resources,  sensor data and other resources. If a connectivity between cooperating units is temporarily lost, each unit will be self-sufficient. However the discrepancy in computation results (if any) will be reconciled once the connectivity is restored so that the units may resume sharing the data processing load further.
