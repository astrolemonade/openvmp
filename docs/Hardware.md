# OpenVMP

## How to build your own OpenVMP robot

The instructions to build OpenVMP robots are starting to take shape in the
[models](../models/REAME.md) module. Please, reach out to us if you are ready to
offer your CadQuery skills for publishing the rest of the blueprints.

Once the entire set of blueprints is published, anyone would be able to build them
given necessary metal cutting and 3D printing tools.
An effort is made to restrict the choice of parts
to a limited set of components available on the market
at an affordable price.
For example, most of actuators of the robot Don1 are NEMA17 stepper motors
similar to those found in most of consumer grade 3D printers.
