## How to build your own OpenVMP robot

The instructions to build OpenVMP robots are not yet released.
Apologies for treating our work as art and not willing to release it
before it's finished (or at least reaches certain level of maturity).

Once released, anyone would be able to build them
given necessary metal cutting and 3D printing tools.
An effort is made to restrict the choice of parts
to a limited set of components available on the market
at an affordable price.
For example, most of actuators of the robot Don1 are NEMA17 stepper motors
similar to those found in most of consumer grade 3D printers.
