# OpenVMP

Open Versatile Mobility Platform implements multi-modal mobility mechanisms that perform arbitrary tasks collectively or individually.

## Multi-modal mobility

OpenVMP allows to create robots that can use different modes of transportation:

- driving on road or off road using wheels
- crawling on multiple points
- walking straight on two legs
- climbing trees, poles, pipes, ropes and cables
- climbing and driving inside pipes and tunnels 

## Collective performance

Multiple OpenVMP units can not only share their resources to achieve computation and communication goals, but also join their bodies mechanically to improve mobility performance. The enhanced mobility performance can be best seen in case of climbing complex structures (like trees) or crawling across complex terrain (such as passing wide openins or passing tall barriers).

## Individual performance

Single OpenVMP units can perform many tasks by themselves over an extended period of time. But they can also leave a collective of OpenRP units to perform a one-off task to aid the performance of the rest of the collective (recon, comms, supply, delivery).
